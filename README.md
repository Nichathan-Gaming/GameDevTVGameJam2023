Name of the game: <b>Bjornlief's Lament</b>

This game is about a descendant of vikings Bjorn and Bera - Bjornlief. After another bloody raid, during which he had to slaughter an entire village to protect his brothers, he began to experience nightmares. Now every night he has the same dream, where he is forced to survive and defend himself in a seemingly endless hell. At the beginning of each dream, he sees three words, the last of which he had previously perceived differently.
